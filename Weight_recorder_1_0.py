    Description: This program's functions are:
    - Prompting the user to record their weight and automatically recording the date and time of the entry.
    - Saving this data in two separate .txt files (weights.txt and dates.txt).
    - If previous data (in weights.txt and dates.txt) is present, then the script appends the new results to these files.
